# Benchmarks — Vinay. Compare Uniform5/40, DistanceLOD, UtilityLOD.
# Report analytical vs measured separately. See docs/datasets-benchmarks.md
# Results/dumps are git-ignored; only harnesses + summaries land here.

## Offline local run

Run this from the repository root after placing the original datasets under
the configured `data/raw/` paths:

```bash
benchmarks/run_local.sh --dataset semanticposs --sequence 00 --count 10 --warmup-frames 2 --repetitions 3
benchmarks/run_local.sh --dataset rellis3d --sequence 00000 --count 10 --warmup-frames 2 --repetitions 3
```

The wrapper builds the local `veyra_benchmark` target and then runs the same
selected frames through all four public policy adapters (`Uniform5`,
`Uniform40`, `DistanceLOD`, and stateful `UtilityLOD`). It uses identical V2
digest-protected inputs, map setup, warmup, and repetitions for every policy.
`UtilityLOD` loads the checked-in hysteresis/prediction configuration and
resource-governor configuration in the C++ runtime. It performs no network
access and writes schema-v2 JSON/CSV results to `benchmark-results/` by
default. JSON records runtime hardware/config provenance, scoped stage timing,
logical versus allocated-map memory availability, current/peak process RSS,
per-level cells, topology churn, and stream late/drop accounting.
